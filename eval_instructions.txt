I have a trained model within the folder ast-a40.160319 . Please analyze the structure and and generate an model_evaluation script that: 1. I can pass the folder name (in this case ast-a40.1600319 to as command line argument 2. reads in the train and test splits from the splits-[...] folder within the folder 3. computes embeddings for all tracks by passing all 3 chunks through the trained model (in eval mode) and averaging them for each track (get chunks from the directory ./precomputed_AST) 4. computes cluster centroids by for each subgenre averaging over all track embeddings that belong to that subgenre  5. computes and prints a cosine similarity matrix between the cluster centroids 6. computes and prints a cosine similarity matrix for each test track with each subgenre centroid, prefix the test tracks with the subgenre in the print, for each track in the table mark the centroid which it has the highest similarity to 7. computes an evaluation accuracy by checking how many of the test tracks actually have the highest cosine similarity to the subgenre centroids of their true subgenre 8. Visualizes the embedding space with UMAP showing the cluster centroids as well as the test tracks of each subgenre
